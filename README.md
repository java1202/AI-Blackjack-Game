# AI-Blackjack-Game

Welcome to the AI Blackjack Game repository! This project is a C++ implementation of a Blackjack game with AI-powered players. The game features a text-based user interface, and it incorporates advanced AI strategies, dynamic risk assessments, and reinforcement learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design:** The project is organized into different files, each handling a specific aspect of the game (e.g., cards, deck, players).
- **AI Strategies:** The game includes advanced AI strategies for both the player and the dealer, optimizing decisions based on the current game state.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The AI player learns and improves its decisions through reinforcement learning, maximizing profits over multiple simulations.
- **Simulation:** Simulations are used to collect data for training the AI player, fine-tuning its strategy based on different scenarios.
- **Text-Based UI:** The user interacts with the game through a simple text-based interface in the terminal/command prompt.
- **Documentation:** The code is well-documented with comments for clarity. A user guide is provided to explain game interaction and AI strategies.
